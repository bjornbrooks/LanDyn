LanDyn is an R library of miscillaneous functions I have found useful for processing rasters and other geospatial objects.  Some functions are simple elaborations of functions in R's core, while others are new functions for performing spatial pattern analysis.

# If you don't have it yet, install 'devtools':
install.packages('devtools')
# Now install LanDyn
devtools::install_github('bjornbrooks/LanDyn')
# Refer to the manual for useful demos and vignettes. Then explore and enjoy!
